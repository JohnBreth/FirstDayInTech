# FirstDayInTech

This is a fun little game that was inspired by the Trapped in a cabin with Lord Byron simulator/RPG, with the original concept and rules by Oliver Darkshire: Henry Sotherans, LTD.
I created a jpg for this for you to use as a dice game. But then I saw that there was a python version that was coded by [Imaginos the Quantum Magician](https://github.com/TheQuantumMagician/byron_gh/blob/main/byron_gh.py).

I took that script as insporation and added a few modifications, as well as used rich formatting to add some flair!
